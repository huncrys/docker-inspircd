# InspIRCd

InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++ for Linux, BSD, Windows and Mac OS X systems which was created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight.

InspIRCd is one of only a few IRC servers to provide a tunable number of features through the use of an advanced but well-documented module system. By keeping core functionality to a minimum we hope to increase the stability, security, and speed of InspIRCd while also making it customizable to the needs of many different users.
